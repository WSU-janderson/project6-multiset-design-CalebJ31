Introduction
    - My design will model a player inventory system that uses a HashTable<string, int>. I have chosen this data 
    structure to model my game system because a HashTable is able to store an item(string) and also keep count(int) 
    of how many of this item that we have in our inventory. The reason this is the best data structure to use is
    simply because of the ability to store the number(count) of a certain item that we have. Using a HashTable for
    our game system will be helpful because knowing how many of an item is extremely important, one example of
    it's importantance is crafting items, certain items may require a certain amount of different items in order
    to craft the item.
