Introduction
    - My design will model a player inventory system that uses a HashTable<string, int>. I have chosen this data 
    structure to model my game system because a HashTable is able to store an item(string) and also keep count(int) 
    of how many of this item that we have in our inventory. The reason this is the best data structure to use is
    simply because of the ability to store the number(count) of a certain item that we have. Using a HashTable for
    our game system will be helpful because knowing how many of an item is extremely important, one example of
    it's importantance is crafting items, certain items may require a certain amount of different items in order
    to craft the item.
Design Philosophy 
-Efficiency 
   	 -For my MultiSet implementation, I wanted to prioritize speed in my design. Speed is a huge focus of 
     all modern games; players want to be able to play a game that runs smoothly and gives seemingly instantaneous 
     feedback. For this exact reason, this is the main reasoning behind why the HashTable is an efficient choice 
     for a multiSet implementation. Most operations of the HashTable are constant time, which is perfect for what 
     I want to achieve speed-wise for the game. We can add more instances of an element without allocating extra 
     memory for duplicates.

-Simplicity
 Our Hash Table exemplifies simplicity; we are able to use the string to store the name of the item, then use the 
 int stored in to represent how many occurrences/instances we have of that specific item. This data structure is 
 also very intuitive in how it works, the client can easily see the intention of storing the object name as a 
 string, and then using the int to keep track of the number of occurrences for that element.
